## About Interview Scheduler

- A single-page application (SPA) that allows users to book technical interviews between students and mentors. 
- Appointments can be between the hours of 12 PM and 5 PM, Monday to Friday. 
- Each appointment has one student and one interviewer. 
- When creating a new appointment, the user can enter any student name while the interviewer is chosen from a predefined list. 
- The user can save the appointment and view the entire schedule of appointments on any day of the week. 
- Appointments can also be edited or deleted. 
- The front end is built with React and makes requests to an API to fetch and store appointment data from a database.
